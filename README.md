# IT6042 - Advanced Mobile Application - Final Project


## Project Description

#### Outcome:

* Design and develop sophisticated mobile interfaces that utilise rapid prototyping techniques. 
* Integrate data storage, serialisation techniques and cloud services to create emerging software solutions. 
* Combine relevant code debugging and advanced testing methodologies for developing mobile applications.  
* Amalgamate expert level features of tools and technologies into a compelling mobile app.

#### Scenario:
You are an individual App developer looking for a new app idea. You have three app types (Android app, IOS app and Cross Platform App) to choose from. After some time, you have decided to pick the cross-platform type. Design the wireframe of the app and then implement the complete App using cross platform mobile tool/framework.

#### Planterium:

The mobile application, **Planterium**, aims to address the challenges faced by plant enthusiasts in keeping track of their plant collection and maintaining an effective watering schedule. This application is designed for individuals who have a good knowledge of plants and possess a diverse collection, making it difficult to remember the last time a plant was watered or its age.

#### Documentation:

ProjectDocument is attached to this project to demonstrate the steps that have been taken during the developement of the application, including proof of testing
## Installation

### Basics:

* Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Expo CLI: Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. You can install Expo CLI by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g expo-cli 
```
* Android Studio or Xcode: If you want to run the app on a physical device or emulator, you will need to install either Android Studio (for Android devices) or Xcode (for iOS devices).
* Install Markdown for Code Editor (VS Code), instructions can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown.
* Git: Git is a version control system that you can use to clone this repository and manage your changes. You can download and install Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Usage

To run the project that has been forked, follow these steps:
* Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. You can use the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/forked-repository.git
```
* Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the root directory of the project using the terminal.
* Check if there are any specific installation instructions provided in the README file. Follow those instructions to install any necessary dependencies or libraries.
* If there are no specific instructions, then you should run the following commands to install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
* Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running the following command:
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
* The above command will start the development server and your project will be running on your localhost.
